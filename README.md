# Purpose

Just a repository for any scripts I might want to use to setup a development environment.

Currently assumes an active fish shell for ubuntu. Must change this. And it only install git if missing and sets up some aliases I like. I shall slowly add functionality as I need it.

For macos it installs fish.

You must always create a github token and add a gh_token file in order for the mac setup to work

The End.
